## Introduction

Facial expression recognition is the task of classifying the expressions on facial images into various categories such as anger, fear, surprise, sadness, happiness, and so on. Facial expressions can display personal emotions and indicate an individual’s intentions within a social situation. They are extremely important to the social interaction of individuals.

Facial expression emotion recognition is an intuitive reflection of a person’s mental state, which contains rich emotional information, and is one of the most important forms of interpersonal communication. It can be used in various fields, including psychology. As a celebrity in ancient China, Zeng Guofan’s wisdom involves facial emotion recognition techniques. His book Bing Jian summarizes eight methods on how to identify people, especially how to choose the right one, which means “look at the eyes and nose for evil and righteousness, the lips for truth and falsehood; the temperament for success and fame, the spirit for wealth and fortune; the fingers and claws for ideas, the hamstrings for a setback; if you want to know his consecution, you can focus on what he has said.” It is said that a person’s personality, mind, goodness, and badness can be shown by his face.

## Schedule

### Week 0 - Basic Skills

1. Taking Stock of Past Experience
2. Learning/Revising Python
3. Getting familiar with Version Control Systems(VCS) such as Git, as well as GitHub.
4. Brush up on Terminal commands

To-Do:

- Create a GitHub account (if not created already), share your username, and accept request to join the repository as a collaborator. ~~Optionally follow AWorldOfChaos :)~~
- Complete the following Python task

[Python Task Week 0](https://www.notion.so/Python-Task-Week-0-b572e444bb2e42b79676a564e1c48eca)

### Week 1-2 - Intro To Deep Learning

1. Optionally revise/learn Machine Learning toolkit.
2. Dive into Deep Learning with Neural Networks
3. Study Convolutional Neural Networks

To-Do:

- Read the introductory chapter from “Introduction To Machine Learning - Gurney et. al.” and optionally the theory
- Watch the playlist on implementing Neural networks in PyTorch
- Complete the following tasks

[Phase 1 Tasks](https://www.notion.so/Phase-1-Tasks-1f77d353095140fbb25f65d56ffe74d0)

### Week 3-4 - Final Code

1. Complete the Facial Expression Recognition Project :)

To-Do:

- Code the Model for DeXPression using the given or own Architecture
- Train the Model on the chosen Dataset
- Acquire Sample Results
- Improve Accuracy and Performance
- Submit the Final Project Code with Results and Documentation

### Over and Beyond

1. Exploring Facial Motion Prior Networks (FMPN). Particularly, introducing an additional branch to generate a facial mask so as to focus on facial muscle-moving regions. 
2. Explore attentional convolutional networks to focus on particular parts of the face. This is particularly useful as it does not require domain knowledge like in (1) above.
3. Generating Compact Embeddings for Facial Expression Similarity. Embedding spaces are particularly useful to determine feature similarity for classification tasks
