Found a suitable dataset for facial recognition tasks from the medium link given in the paper. Created a data loader for it in PyTorch. Used DeXpression as the architecture for the final problem statement and coded the network or standard CNN architecture for the classification task . To avoid imbalance due to vast the number of images, I chose 3500 images of each emotion from the MMA dataset. Due to the excessive time it was taking to train a single epoch, it was a little tough to tweak any hyperparameters.
